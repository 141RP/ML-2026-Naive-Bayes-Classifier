# Naive Bayes Spam Classifier From Scratch

This project implements a binary Naive Bayes spam classifier from scratch using
pure Python. The model is evaluated across multiple decision cutoffs to analyze
how performance metrics and confusion matrix rates change with threshold tuning.

## Features
- Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifier
- Laplace smoothing
- Stopword filtering
- Log-probability computation
- Threshold-based decision rule
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 evaluation
- Confusion matrix rate analysis
- Metric and rate visualization

## Run
```bash
python patel_rohin_Train.py
python patel_rohin_Predict.py
